map : more map call type for vectorized or non vectorize type 

generate map functions in c to llvm with clang and modifiy the function names
to add dots in it

typecheck dereferencing non initialized arrays 
type check: differentiate use of array whose size was given
from those which don't

maybe think of a way to make the IR codegen generic so it can be replaced
by another IR (C)

think about some tests

rework the examples so that they present only one feature of the 
langage/compiler at a time

llvm:
	what is sdiv instruction?
	what is the s prefix?


Module for easily manage output colors
(color stack, use the great asprint with gc a lot!)

Better factorisation for type_check error and 
either get rid or finalize that 'source code' thing

allow non constant integer in array declarations to provide a kind of malloc

ADD suffix for differentiate variable with same name 
not in the same level
